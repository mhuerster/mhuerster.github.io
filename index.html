description: My name is Molly Huerster and I'm a software developer living in San Francisco. I mostly code in Ruby on Rails, with a little mobile stuff. When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading or cooking or exploring San Francisco. You might know me a Mary Huerster (especially if you've emailed me!).
