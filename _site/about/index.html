    <p>I'm a native New Yorker: I was born in Park Slope (before it was cool), grew up in Westchester (still hasn't gotten cool), and went to high school on the Upper East Side (which got a lot cooler when Gossip Girl came out).</p>

<p>I'm also a recent (2013) graduate of Washington and Lee University, where I majored in Classics and Politics. I also studied abroad for a semester at the University of St Andrews.</p>

<p>After graduation, I moved back to the New York area and worked in marketing for a year. I was working for a tech startup and loved the environment, but always felt that I wasn't really in on the action because I didn't understand how the product was was made. So, I started to fix it, beginning with HTML and CSS tutorials on Codecademy, eventually working up to JavaScript and Ruby. By the end of the year, I knew I wanted to do this full time, but I also knew I was going to have to learn a lot faster before I could do any meaningful development work. That sense of urgency brought me to Dev Bootcamp. To be continued...</p>
