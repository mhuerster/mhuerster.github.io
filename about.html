So, I started to fix it, beginning with HTML and CSS tutorials on Codecademy, eventually working up to JavaScript and Ruby. By the end of the year, I knew I wanted to do this full time, but I also knew I was going to have to learn a lot faster before I could do any meaningful development work. That sense of urgency brought me to Dev Bootcamp. To be continued...</p>
