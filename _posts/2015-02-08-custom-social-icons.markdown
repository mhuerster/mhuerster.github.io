I recently had to get a set of custom social media sharing icons up and running. It's not technically difficult at all, but I ended up doing more research/legwork than seemed to be really necessary, so here's a quick cheat sheet for Facebook, Twitter and email. (Scroll down for links to gists.)

FYI: The gists are in Haml, but I use Liquid for this blog.

<div
  class="fb-like"
  data-share="false"
  data-width="450"
  data-show-faces="true">
</div>
